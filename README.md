Website made with tailwind.css and javascript to find how much network exp is needed to get the black plus in Hypixel,
if you have enough exp confetti will appear.  
The website uses the cursors from NES.css besides the text select cursor which I designed in paint.net

## How does it work
the website makes a GET request to the Slothpixel API which makes a GET request to the official Hypixel API and returns the exp of the player and then updates the bar, if there's enough exp confetti will appear.

## Confetti
The website uses [JS Confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti) to display the confetti.
